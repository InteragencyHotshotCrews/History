### Crew History, Established 2001

In 2000 the BLM made the decision to add four hotshot crews. The Upper
Snake River District (now Idaho Fall District) was chosen to host one of
these crews in Pocatello, Idaho. Randy Anderson was hired in March 2001
as the superintendent and in approximately 2 months the crew was hired,
equipment purchased, vehicles scrounged and we were up and running. The
crew maintained trainee status for the entire 2001 season and received
hotshot certification in 2002. The crew has a great mutual relationship with
the BLM of Idaho and the Idaho Falls District in regards to fuels projects
and providing experienced personnel in leadership roles. Kenney Bochniak,
an original crewmember from 2001, and Paul Davis are the current crew
foreman. In December 2014 the crew moved into a new operations building
on BLM land in Pocatello.
